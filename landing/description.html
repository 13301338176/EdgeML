      The EdgeML library provides a suit of efficient machine learning
      algorithms designed to work off the grid on severely resource constrained
      scenarios. The library allows the training, evaluation and deployment of
      these algorithms onto various target devices and platforms. EdgeML is
      written in Python using Tensorflow. We also provide experimental PyTorch
      support and highly efficient C++ implementations for certain
      algorithms.</p>
      
      <p>With EdgeML, classical machine learning tasks such as activity
      recognition, gesture recognition, regression, and so forth can be
      efficiently performed on tiny devices like the Arduino Uno, with as low
      as 2kB of RAM. Our fast, accurate and compressed deep learning solutions
      solve complex time-series tasks, for instance, audio key-word detection
      and wakeword detection on processors as small as a Cortex M4.</p>

      <p>This library is a product of the Intelligent Devices Expedition from
      Microsoft Research India. As part of this expedition we strive to push
      the state of the art in machine learning to enable privacy preserving,
      energy-efficient, off-the-grid intelligence on low resource computing devices.
      The EdgeML library is open sourced under the <a
