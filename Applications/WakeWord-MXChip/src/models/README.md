# Naming Convention
ALGORITHM_HIDDIM0_HIDDIM1_VALACC

ALGORITHM:
    1. EMI + Shallow + RNN
    2. Shallow + RNN

Where RNN can be any RNN

HIDDIM0/HIDDIM1: The hidden dimension of the two layers

VALACC: Validation accuracy.

More details of the model can be found in the summary.txt file in the zipped folder.
