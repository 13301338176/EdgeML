# S-RNN Predictor With Google Dataset

This is intendend to work with PlatformIO. Moving it to mbed is pretty
straightfordward though.

For PlatformIO, just installing the platformIO plugin for VSCode and adding
this project to a workspace is all you need to do.

Before adding this project, maybe just make sure you can compile a simple blink
onto the MXChip.

To deploy a differnt model, just extract the *contents* of the model directory
into `src` and run `python generateModelParams.py` from `src`.
