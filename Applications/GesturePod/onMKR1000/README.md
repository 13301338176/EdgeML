## About

GesturePod is a plug-and-play, gesture recognition device. GesturePod can be clamped onto any white-cane used by persons with Visually Impairment. Simple and natural gestures performed on the cane triggers corresponding activities on the phone. This gesture recognition system on the cane has been made possible due to a robust real-time Machine Learning (ML) based Gesture recogntition system based on [ProtoNN](link).

Here in this code base you will find gesture prediction code that runs on a Cortex M0+ microcontroller. 

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and navigate to this folder
	```
	git clone ...
	cd BLEProtoNNPredictor
	```
2. Refer to this tutorial to build the Hardware and setup external dependencies - [Cortex M0+ Board support](https://www.hackster.io/charifmahmoudi/arduino-mkr1000-getting-started-08bb4a).
		
3. Compile, Build and Upload
	Select the ```COM``` port to which MKR1000 is connected.
	Upload the code.

4. Launch the ```COM``` port and perform gestures on the cane to get the results of live predictions.
