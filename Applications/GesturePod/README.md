* ```onMKR1000``` : If you have the GesturePod hardware ready, navigate to the ```onMKR1000``` directory for the code that runs on your GesturePod.
* ```onComputer``` : If you do not have the hardware, you can simulate gesture recognition on your computer as well. We have stored sensor data for you! Navigate to ```onComputer```.
