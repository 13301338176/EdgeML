## About 

GesturePod is a plug-and-play, gesture recognition device. In this repository we share: 

a) Code that powers the GesturePod, recognizes the the gesture and communicates the gesture over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 

b) A pertrained model that recognizes 5 gestures - Double Tap, Right Twist, Left Twist, Twirl and Double Swipe with an accuracy of 99.87.

## Organization

This directory is subdivided into two further directories:

```onMKR1000``` : If you have the Hardware ready, navigate to the ```onMKR1000``` directory to burn the code onto the GesturePod.

```onWorkstation``` : If you do not have the hardware, you can run the gesture recognition on your computer as well. We have stored sensor data for you! Navigate to ```onWorkstation```.
