*GesturePod* is a plug-and-play, gesture recognition device
that is designed to be clamped onto any white-cane used by 
persons with Visually Impairment. Once clamped onto the cane
firmly, simple and natural gestures performed on the cane 
can be used to interact with various devices, for instance 
a mobile phone.
