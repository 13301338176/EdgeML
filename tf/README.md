# EdgeML: Tensorflow Implementations 

This directory includes, Tensorflow implementations of various techniques and
algorithms developed as part of EdgeML. Currently, the following algorithms are
available in Tensorflow:

1. [ProtoNN](https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/publications/ProtoNN.pdf)
2. [Bonsai](https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/publications/Bonsai.pdf)
3. FastGRNN & FastRNN
4. EMI-RNN

Usage directions and examples of all of the above algorithms are provided in
`examples` subdirectory.
